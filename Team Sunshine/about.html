        <h3> What We Do</h3> <br>
        <p>Pediatric patients and their families can participate in volunteer-led programming provided by Project Sunshine in a number of medical settings. Whether a kid needs immediate or ongoing care, we are aware of the enormous responsibility that comes with managing their medical condition or injury. Since every child with a medical condition is different, our programs try to cater to their particular needs. <br>
        <br>
        Our mission is simple: <br>
        To deliver the healing power of play to children with medical needs through trained and dedicated volunteers.<br>
        <br>
        By putting volunteers in touch with young patients and their families, we have been able to help thousands of children through tough times. With our in-person program, Project Sunshine volunteers have been personally bringing happiness and joy to pediatric patients at our network of hospitals and healthcare partners across the nation for more than 20 years.

        <h3>Our Impact</h3> <br>
        <p>Project Sunshine partners with over 480 hospitals and medical centers in over 300 cities across the United States and 3 international locations to connect them with over 16,000 trained volunteers who deliver socially driven activities to pediatric patients and their families.<br> <br>Our programs have been able to impact over 190,000 paitents and families! We were able to do this by collaborating with child life specialists and other healthcare professionals to establish spaces for children to interact socially and take part in enjoyable activities that are both enjoyable and enlightening.<br>
            <br> Opportunities for play and mental exercise redirect patients from their physical and emotional hardships, provide caretakers withÂ some time to tend to their own needs, and assist healthcare providers through providing extra services and resources for their paitents.

         <p><br>With generous funding from Gilead Sciences and collaboration with Bomu Hospital in Mombasa, Kenya, Project Sunshine has been helping at-risk children with HIV and their families since 2006. We personally assisted more than 28,000 kids and families in 2019 alone, 11,400 of whom benefited from our in-clinic programs. Through creative arts activities and tutoring sessions with kids who are missing school to be at the clinic, the in-clinic programs, which are delivered by trained Project Sunshine Volunteers, offer emotional and developmental assistance to thousands of kids.<br>
